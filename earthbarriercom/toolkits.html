        having established a functioning genetic engineering pipeline from
        scratch, we're excited to stretch its wings. with this, we're working on
        our first climate technology toolkits that will be comprehensive systems for engineering living systems, of any scale, to specification. to showcase
        this, our first toolkit will be designed to combat harmful algal blooms.
        for future toolkits, we want to develop these toolkits alongside our
        clients to best build them in a manner that interfaces easily and
        predictably with your current or projected engineering pipeline.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p class="body">
        our toolkits will be available to the public upon launch of each kit
        with highly-characterized specifications provided alongside
        them. that being said, we're happy to work closely with clients
        during the development stage in a hushed manner, affording early-birds a
        first-mover advantage. if you chose to work with us in this fashion,
        you'll have access to the entirety of the toolkit as it is being
        developed and flexible payment plans and first-mover discounts not
        afforded once the kits drop to the general public. we're really excited
        about working with both new and established companies to develop these
        toolkits and we think you'll find partnering with us for the development
        phase to be economically advantageous. while the base technology of our
        toolkits is branched from our in-house innovations, we'd be thrilled to
        interface with innovations from your side of the sandbox as well.
        whether you need to make single-nucleotide precision edits or reengineer
        mesoscale ecological systems, we're building the tools to bring your
        vision to life.
